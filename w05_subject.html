<h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjOgMLlv5yEAxUWlYkEHdhbBgYQFnoECGoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTable_tennis&usg=AOvVaw1yKmOK4-atD2P0Xa0URTJe&opi=89978449">Table tennis</a>, also known as ping pong recreationally, is a racket sport that includes using a wooden table with a net that divides the table into halves horizontally. A line, usually white, divides the table into halves vertically.

<h2>Player Positions</h2>
<p>
In a team, let's say a school team, there are starters which are players who play in competitions between schools and individuals of each school. There are other players who can both be substitutes or starters in-training. A team of starters contains 7 players: 3 singles players and 2 pairs of doubles players.
