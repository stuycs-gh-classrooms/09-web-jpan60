  In a team, let's say a school team, there are starters which are players who play in competitions between schools and individuals of each school. There are other players who can both be substitutes or starters in-training. A team of starters contains 7 players: 3 singles players and 2 pairs of doubles players.
  There can also be mixed doubles players, meaning that one player from a women’s team and one from the men’s team form a pair for doubles.
